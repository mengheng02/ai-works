Genetic Algorithms\n","# Task 3.3 The Map Colouring Problem\n","## Problem Descriptions\n","![picture](https://github.com/mengheng02/image-file/blob/main/map%20colouring.png?raw=true)\n","\n","Given 11 names in the map and 4 colours, design a genetic algorithm and implement a program to colour the map while ensuring no neighbouring regions in the map have the same colour. Firstly, the genetic algorithm is designed by specifying the encoding scheme, fitness function, and genetic operators.\n","\n","1. Encoding scheme: Symbolic encoding is selected as the encoding scheme for this problem, where each region is represented by an element in a list of size 11. Values of 0-3 are assigned for 4 colours, and each value represents the colour assigned to the corresponding region.\n","\n","2. Fitness function: The fitness function is evaluated by the number of neighbouring regions that have the same colour. The fitness value of the optimal solution of the map colouring problem should be 0, indicating no neighbouring regions have the same colour.\n","\n","3. Genetic operators:\n","  *   Selection: Using tournament selection. Each tournament consists of 3 individuals and the winner of each tournament is selected to be parents of the next generation.\n","\n","  *   Crossover: A 2-point crossover is performed, 2 random points are selected on parents' chromosomes, and swabbed.\n","  \n","  *   Mutation: Randomly choose a region and change its colour. This is accomplished by randomly choosing an element in the list and changing its value from 0-3. Any value beyond this range will result in an invalid list. The possibility of mutation is set to be 5% in this task.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Implementation and Results"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BprDObXyHJBV","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700419692883,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":9299,"user":{"displayName":"mh chong","userId":"16669753525538908106"}},"outputId":"9e4f2fcb-4ac7-4dfd-8822-b32ab743594c"},"source":["!pip install deap\n","import array\n","import random\n","import numpy as np\n","from deap import creator, base, tools, algorithms"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting deap\n","  Downloading deap-1.4.1-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_5_x86_64.manylinux1_x86_64.manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (135 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m135.4/135.4 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from deap) (1.23.5)\n","Installing collected packages: deap\n","Successfully installed deap-1.4.1\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"smxceTnEymf7"},"source":["# Specify the variables\n","numColour = 4\n","numNames = 11\n","colours = ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'gray')\n","names = ('Mark', 'Julia', 'Steve', 'Amanda', 'Brian',\n","         'Joanne', 'Derek', 'Allan', 'Michelle', 'Kelly', 'Chris')\n","\n","# Define the neighbours\n","neighbours =  [ [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n","                [0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FGcjQHrUHWyu"},"source":["def evalMapColouring(ind):\n","    val = 0\n","    for i in range(0, numNames):\n","      for j in range(0, numNames):\n","        if (neighbours[i][j] == 1) and (ind[i] == ind[j]):\n","            val += 1\n","    return val,\n","\n","creator.create(\"FitnessMin\", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0,))\n","creator.create(\"Individual\", array.array, typecode='i', fitness=creator.FitnessMin)\n","\n","toolbox = base.Toolbox()\n","toolbox.register(\"attr_colour\", random.randint, 0, numColour-1)\n","toolbox.register(\"individual\", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_colour, numNames)\n","toolbox.register(\"population\", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)\n","\n","toolbox.register(\"evaluate\", evalMapColouring)\n","toolbox.register(\"mate\", tools.cxTwoPoint)\n","toolbox.register(\"mutate\", tools.mutUniformInt, low=0, up=numColour-1, indpb=0.05)\n","toolbox.register(\"select\", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fDdDaVawHrC4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700419693229,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":349,"user":{"displayName":"mh chong","userId":"16669753525538908106"}},"outputId":"c0d17a3d-d5fa-406a-e09d-f3d23bd98717"},"source":["pop = toolbox.population(n=10)\n","stats = tools.Statistics(lambda ind: ind.fitness.values)\n","stats.register(\"min\", np.min)\n","pop, log = algorithms.eaSimple(pop, toolbox, cxpb=0.8, mutpb=0.4, ngen=100,\n","                              stats=stats, verbose=True)\n","\n","best = tools.selBest(pop, 1)[0]\n","print(\"Best: %s.
