Image Processing\n","# Task 7.3 Object recognition\n","## Problem Descriptions\n","Object detection is an application of computer vision that identifies and locates the object within a box on the image or video. In this task, we implement the yolov3 model and the yolov3-tiny model to perform object detection tasks on the input image. The procedure can be written as follows.\n","\n","1. Setup environment\n"," * Installing and importing the 'cvlib' library to Colab notebook.\n"," * From the 'cvlib' library, specifically import draw_box and YOLO from  \n","   cvlib.\n","\n","2. Download the pre-trained YOLO model:\n"," *  The YOLO package required in this task would be yolov3-tiny.cfg, yolov3-tiny.weights, yolov3.txt, yolov3.cfg, yolov3.weights, and yolov3.txt.\n"," * Download those files to Google Drive.\n","\n","3. Load the YOLO Model:\n"," * Load the YOLO files from the Google Drive.\n"," * Initializing the YOLO model with the pre-trained weights, config, and\n","   labels.\n","\n","4. Upload the image file to the colab notebook.\n","\n","5. Using the OpenCV library to read the input image.\n"," * Import the 'cv2' function to read the input image.\n"," * The image is  pre-processed to fit the input requirements of the YOLO\n","   model, which typically includes resizing the image and normalizing its pixel values.\n","6. Pass the processed image to the YOLO model.\n"," * The YOLO model will output detected objects with their bounding boxes,\n","   confidence scores, and class labels.\n","\n","7. Display the result.\n"," * Use the draw_bbox() function to generate the bounding boxes on the output\n","   image of the YOLO model.\n"," * Import and apply cv2_imshow from Google.colab.patches to display the  output images in Google Colab.\n","\n","\n","##Implementation and
