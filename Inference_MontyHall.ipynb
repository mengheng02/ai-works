Probabilistic Inference\n","# Task 4.3 Monty Hall Problem Using Bayesian Network\n","## Problem Descriptions\n","In the Monty Hall problem, there are 2 doors with goats behind and 1 door with a car behind. The contestant needs to choose the door with the car behind to win the prize. First, the contestant chooses a door out of 3 doors, and the host who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door that has a goat. Now there are only 2 doors left and the contestant needs to decide to stick to original choice, or switch to another door.\n","\n","In this task, we calculate the probability of a prize behind each door using a Bayesian network. The Bayesian network for the Monty Hall problem can be defined as follows.\n","\n","---\n","1. Definition of variables\n"," * Contestant's choice (C): Door chosen by the contestant at the beginning. This variable has 3 possible values {Door 0, Door 1, Door 2}.\n","\n"," * Door with the prize (P): The door with the prize behind it, this variable also has 3 possible values {Door 0, Door 1, Door 2}.\n","\n"," * Host's Choice (H): The door the host opens. The host will always open a door that does not have the prize and was not picked by the contestant. This variable also has three possible values {Door 0, Door 1, Door 2}.\n","\n","2. Construction of the Bayesian network\n"," * P → H: The host's choice of which door to open depends on where the prize is. He must open the door that has a goat behind.\n","  \n"," * C → H: The host's choice also depends on the contestant's initial choice. He must open the door that was not picked by the contestant.\n","\n","3. Prior Probabilities\n","    * P(P): The probability distribution of the prize being each door is the same, so it is 1/3 possibility of prize for each door.\n","   \n","   \n","      P(Prize = Door 0) = P(Prize = Door 1) = P(Prize = Door 2) = 1/3\n","\n"," * P(C): The contestant's initial choice is also equally likely to be any of the three doors.\n","\n","\n","      P(Choice = Door 0) = P(Choice = Door 1) = P(Choice = Door 2) = 1/3\n","\n","4. Conditional Probabilities\n","\n","P(H | P, C): Given the door with the prize behind and the contestant's initial choice, the probability of the host opening the door with a goat varies in 2 possible situations. Let's assume the door with the prize behind is door 1.\n"," * Situation 1: The contestant chooses the prize door (P=C) at the beginning, and the host can open either of the remaining 2 doors with the goat behind. Since there are only 2 remaining doors, the probability would be 50%.\n","\n","        P(H = Door 0 | P = Door 1, C = Door 1) = 1/2\n","        P(H = Door 1 | P = Door 1, C = Door 1) = 0\n","        P(H = Door 2 | P = Door 1, C = Door 1) = 1/2\n","\n","\n","* Situation 2: The contestant doesn't choose the prize door (P≠C), the host has only one choice (the door that is neither P nor C), so the probability would be 100%. If the contestant opens door 0, the host can only open door 2; If the contestant opens door 2, the host can only choose door 0.\n","        If the contestant chooses door 0,\n","        P(H = Door 0 | P = Door 1, C = Door 0) = 0\n","        P(H = Door 1 | P = Door 1, C = Door 0) = 0\n","        P(H = Door 2 | P = Door 1, C = Door 0) = 1\n","\n","        If the contestant chooses door 2,\n","        P(H = Door 0 | P = Door 1, C = Door 2) = 1\n","        P(H = Door 1 | P = Door 1, C = Door 2) = 0\n","        P(H = Door 2 | P = Door 1, C = Door 2) = 0\n","\n","\n","## Implementation and
