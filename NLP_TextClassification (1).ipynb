Natural Language Processing\n","# Task 6.2 Text Classification\n","## Problem Descriptions\n","In this task, text classification aims to classify messages into a predefined topic category. The problem can be formulated as follows:\n","1. Collection of texts with class labels:\n"," * Choose rec. motorcycles, talk. politics. guns, comp.windows.x, and sci. med from the sklearn newsgroups dataset as text collection for modelling.\n","2. Data preprocessing:\n"," * Tokenization: Split the word of the movie review into the individual token\n"," * Removing stopword: Remove words that don't contribute to the overall sentiment of the movie review such as \"is\", \"may\", or \"the\".\n"," * Convert all words into lowercase to ensure uniformity.\n"," * Stemming or lemmatization: Reduces the word to its root form.\n","\n","\n","3. Extract the word count features: Convert the processed newsgroup dataset into a Bag-of-word representation, so that it is suitable for the machine learning model. Either one of the word count feature extraction approaches is implemented.\n"," *  tf feature:  tf stands for term frequency, it counts how often a vocabulary is present in that document (message).\n","          tf(t,d)=count of term t in the document (message)\n","                  /total number of words in the document d (message).\n"," *  Extract td-idf feature: A word with a high tf-idf score means that the word is specific to the particular document (message) but not common in the entire newsgroup dataset. tf-idf score can be calculated by using the formula below.\n","                \n","          idf(t, D)=log[(total number of messages in newsgroup dataset D)\n","                        /(number of messages containing term t)]\n","                 \n","          tfidf(t,d,D)=tf(t,d)*idf(t,D)\n","             \n","4. Build the naÃ¯ve Bayes classifier from the training set\n"," * In this case, multinomial Naive Bayes model is used because it is suitable for modelling discrete data in text classification task.\n","\n","\n","5. Apply the classifier on the testing data set to classify new messages into their category.    \n","\n","6. Evaluate the performance of the model in handling testing data by using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Implementation and Results"],"metadata":{"id":"icGhIYQLJMnh"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pOQvTfSeBLUb"},"source":["from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cH4teCzlBXT_"},"source":["# Get the training dataset for the specified categoires\n","categories = ['rec.motorcycles', 'talk.politics.guns',\n","              'comp.windows.x', 'sci.med']\n","training_data = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', categories=categories)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"czsV4bIXBvQk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1703538103820,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":953,"user":{"displayName":"mh chong","userId":"16669753525538908106"}},"outputId":"980d1efe-0e1c-4a1c-803e-94ad776626c3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["# Create the tf-idf transformer\n","tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(use_idf=True)\n","# tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(use_idf=False)\n","training_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(training_data.data)\n","print(training_tfidf.shape)\n","\n","# Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier\n","classifier = MultinomialNB().fit(training_tfidf, training_data.target)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["(2331, 40367)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"myGwhvndBvHj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1703538108014,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":1933,"user":{"displayName":"mh chong","userId":"16669753525538908106"}},"outputId":"b94c8cd1-4faf-4ff2-87b9-cf416e05313f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["from sklearn import metrics\n","\n","testing_data = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test', categories=categories)\n","testing_tfidf = tfidf.transform(testing_data.data)\n","predictions = classifier.predict(testing_tfidf)\n","print(metrics.classification_report(testing_data.target, predictions, target_names=categories))\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["                    precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","   rec.motorcycles       0.98      0.94      0.96       395\n","talk.politics.guns       0.96      0.98      0.97       398\n","    comp.windows.x       0.98      0.91      0.94       396\n","           sci.med       0.90      0.99      0.94       364\n","\n","          accuracy                           0.95      1553\n","         macro avg       0.95      0.95      0.95      1553\n","      weighted avg       0.95      0.95      0.95      1553\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aumqFItjFPYg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1703538113979,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":228,"user":{"displayName":"mh chong","userId":"16669753525538908106"}},"outputId":"d52b7049-675b-4681-8a04-b695f7573d10","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"source":["errors = [i for i in range(len(predictions)) if predictions[i] != testing_data.target[i]]\n","\n","for i, post_id in enumerate(errors[:5]):\n","  print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n","  print(\"%s --> %s\\n\" %(testing_data.target_names[testing_data.target[post_id]],\n","                      testing_data.target_names[predictions[post_id]]))\n","  print(testing_data.data[post_id])\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["------------------------------------------------------------------\n","sci.med --> comp.windows.x\n","\n","From: andrewm@bio.uts.EDU.AU (Andrew Mears)\n","Subject: sheep models in cardiology\n","Organization: University of Technology, Sydney\n","Lines: 18\n","Distribution: world\n","NNTP-Posting-Host: iris.bio.uts.edu.au\n","Keywords: sheep ovine arrhythmias\n","\n","\n","Dear news readers,\n","\n","Is there anyone using sheep models for cardiac research, specifically\n","concerned with arrhythmias, pacing or defibrillation?

What they'd like to do is:\n","Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\n","data  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\n","link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\n","picture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\n","might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\n","pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\n","would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\n","painted.\n","\n","Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\n","of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted\n","as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to\n","be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\n","small  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\n","magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\n","server  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\n","ask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\n","only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\n","(\"Permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window?\n","\n","It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\n","such  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\n","one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\n","But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice\n","to hear about it.
