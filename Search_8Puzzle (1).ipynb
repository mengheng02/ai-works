Search\n","# Task 2.2 8-Puzzy Problem\n","## Problem Descriptions\n","In this problem, we have a 3x3 grid filled with numbered tiles from 1 to 8 and a blank space. Tiles are jumbled up at the beginning, and we need to arrange all tiles until they are numerically in order with a blank space. The program aims to find a solution with the least movement to arrange tiles into the target order. Firstly, the problem is defined with state, action, goal test, and path cost.\n","\n","1. State: Position tiles in 3x3 arrays with numbers 1-8 and 'E' for the blank space. These positions are represented by one string with dashes, and the sequence of string elements is corresponding to the position of tiles in the 3x3 array.\n","\n","2. Action: Action is represented by movement of the blank tile up, down, left, and right. However, boundary conditions must be checked to decide which 4 moves are valid for a specific state.\n","\n","3. Goal test: The goal test checks whether the current state is 'E-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8'. If yes, the solution is found and the search is ended.\n","\n","4. Path cost: Path cost is the number of moves used to arrange jumbled tiles to target order. Therefore, 1 cost represents 1 move.\n","\n","\n","\n","## Implementation and Results"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"K7-T2GkQ99WU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1703819499085,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":7961,"user":{"displayName":"mh chong","userId":"16669753525538908106"}},"outputId":"1bb3faa7-f9b5-41e7-b61d-0ec09c33a9ff"},"source":["!pip install simpleai\n","from simpleai.search import SearchProblem, astar, greedy, breadth_first, depth_first\n","\n","import time\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: simpleai in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.3)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"khxQXKs1-Obs"},"source":["# Class returning no.of misplaced tiles to solve the puzzle\n","class NoOfMisplacedTilesPuzzleSolver(SearchProblem):\n","\n","      # Action method to get the list of the possible numbers that can be moved in to the empty space\n","      def actions(self, cur_state):\n","          rows = string_to_list(cur_state)\n","          row_empty, col_empty = get_location(rows, 'E')\n","\n","          actions = []\n","          if row_empty > 0: actions.append(rows[row_empty -

All search algorithms generate a solution with 4 moves except depth-first search, which generates a run time error using both heuristic functions.\n","\n","Looking at the execution time of various search algorithms using heuristic with the number of misplaced tiles, A* search was completed in 490 µs, greedy best-first search in 406 µs, and breadth-first search in 1.47 ms. However, a run time error is occurred when a depth-first search is executed. As a result, greedy best-first search is the fastest search algorithm to solve the simple case of 4 solution depth using heuristic with the number of misplaced tiles, while breadth-first search is the slowest, and depth-first search is impractical.\n","\n","By observing the execution time of each search algorithm using heuristic with Manhattan distance, A* search was executed in 600 µs, greedy best-first search in 633 µs, and breadth-first search in 1.29 ms. However, a run time error occurred once again when the depth-first search was implemented. Therefore, A* search is the fastest search algorithm to solve the simple case of 4 solution depth using this heuristic, while breadth-first search is the slowest, and depth-first search is impractical.\n","\n","\n","\n","###Difficult case\n","A* search and greedy best-first search have been implemented to solve the difficult case '7-2-4-5-E-6-8-3-1' using both heuristic functions. Both A* search and greedy best-first search give a run time error using a heuristic with the number of misplaced tiles. When using the heuristic with Manhattan distance, A* search generates a solution of 26 moves in 22.3s, while greedy best-first search gives a run time error once again.\n","\n","The potential reason for run time error might be due to either a poor heuristic function being implemented, rendering it challenging to find the solution or an excessive number of generated nodes during the search exceeding control limits, consuming lots of memory and causing crashed at the end. Another potential reason is that search algorithm get trapped in an infinity loop during puzzle solving.\n","\n","In summary, only A star search employing with heuristic based on the Manhattan distance can generate a solution for a difficult case of 26 solution depth. Further investigation is required to address run-time error.\n"]}]}
