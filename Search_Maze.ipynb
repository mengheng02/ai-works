The maze is constructed by walls ('#') and open path (blank space). The search problem can be defined as follows.\n","\n","1. State: Current position within the maze and is represented by (x,y)\n","  coordinates.\n","\n","2. Action: Valid horizontal and vertical movement can be made in the maze to reach the target point ('X') while avoiding the wall ('#'), which includes up, down, left, and right. For an extended search, the valid movement is expanded to move diagonally, which includes up left, up right, down left, and down right.\n","\n","3. Goal test： Check whether the current state is the target point ('X').\n","\n","4. Path cost： Total movement used to reach the target point ('X) from the starting point ('0'). Each vertical or horizontal movement costs 1 and each diagonal movement costs 1.4.\n","\n","5. Heuristic function: Euclidean distance, is the straight line distance from starting point to the target point. It is suitable especially when diagonal movements are allowed. It can be calculated by using the Pythagorean theorem.\n","                      \n","                            c=sqrt(a^2+b^2)\n","\n","\n","## Implementation and Results"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qinJknR5WEzC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1703743617846,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":15210,"user":{"displayName":"mh chong","userId":"16669753525538908106"}},"outputId":"d05a6323-9912-47c9-daf1-dfb5c040cab3"},"source":["!pip install simpleai\n","from simpleai.search import SearchProblem, astar, greedy, breadth_first, depth_first, uniform_cost\n","import math"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting simpleai\n","  Downloading simpleai-0.8.3.tar.gz (94 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m94.4/94.4 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m1.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Building wheels for collected packages: simpleai\n","  Building wheel for simpleai (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for simpleai: filename=simpleai-0.8.3-py3-none-any.whl size=100984 sha256=446d9572c95db58ec70985ea31fc8ed79f1e48004790f63d46356b2daf1aaa16\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/91/0c/38/421d7910e7bc59b97fc54f490808bdb1097607d83d1a592865\n","Successfully built simpleai\n","Installing collected packages: simpleai\n","Successfully installed simpleai-0.8.3\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pEDEpmGzXklh"},"source":["MAP = \"\"\"\n","##############################\n","#         #              #   #\n","# ####    ########       #   #\n","#  o #    #              #   #\n","#    ###     ####   ######   #\n","#         ####      #        #\n","#            #  #   #   #### #\n","#     ######    #       # x  #\n","#        #      #            #\n","##############################\n","\"\"\"\n","MAP = [list(x) for x in MAP.split(\"\\n\") if x]\n","\n","COSTS = {\n","    \"up\": 1.0,\n","    \"down\": 1.0,\n","    \"left\": 1.0,\n","    \"right\": 1.0,\n","    \"up left\": 1.4,\n","    \"up right\": 1.4,\n","    \"down left\": 1.4,\n","    \"down right\": 1.4,\n","}\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vZKngpxpX8Lj"},"source":["\n","class Maze(SearchProblem):\n","\n","    def __init__(self, board):\n","        self.board = board\n","        self.goal = (0, 0)\n","        for y in range(len(self.board)):\n","            for x in range(len(self.board[y])):\n","                if self.board[y][x].lower() == \"o\":\n","                    self.initial = (x, y)\n","                elif self.board[y][x].lower() == \"x\":\n","                    self.goal = (x, y)\n","\n","        super(Maze, self).__init__(initial_state=self.initial)\n","\n","    def actions(self, state):\n","        actions = []\n","        for action in list(COSTS.keys()):\n","            newx, newy = self.result(state, action)\n","            if self.board[newy][newx] != \"#\":\n","                actions.append(action)\n","        return actions\n","\n","    def result(self, state, action):\n","        x, y = state\n","\n","        if action.count(\"up\"):\n","            y -= 1\n","        if action.count(\"down\"):\n","            y += 1\n","        if action.count(\"left\"):\n","            x -= 1\n","        if action.count(\"right\"):\n","            x += 1\n","\n","        new_state = (x, y)\n","        return new_state\n","\n","    def is_goal(self, state):\n","        return state == self.goal\n","\n","    def cost(self, state, action, state2):\n","        return COSTS[action]\n","\n","    def heuristic(self, state):\n","        x, y = state\n","        gx, gy = self.goal\n","        return math.sqrt((x -

After applying all search algorithms, all A* search, greedy best-first search, breadth-first search, depth-first search, and uniform cost search use 33 moves with 33 path costs to reach the target point. Such a situation might be due to limited movement options available, there are no alternative paths to reach the target if only using horizontal and vertical movements.\n","\n","Using extended search\n","\n","In extended search, we can perform horizontal, vertical, and diagonal movements while avoiding the wall.

However, the depth-first search took a very long path to reach the target, which might be due to increased movement complexity. Depth-first search tends to explore the deepest end of the movement option made and is likely to get trapped into longer alternative paths.\n","\n","It is not impossible that A* search, breadth-first search, and uniform cost search still give an identical path cost again given more complex movement options. All A* search, uniform cost search, and greedy best-first search consider the path cost during path exploration, but in different ways. Although the breadth-first search didn't take path costs into account, there is a possibility that it finds an optimal path when exploring all the shallowest paths before going to deep.\n","\n","In conclusion, searching path cost can be minimized given more complex movement options but it might not work on depth-first search. Depth-first search is likely to get trapped into longer alternative paths due to its searching nature.\n","\n"]}]}
